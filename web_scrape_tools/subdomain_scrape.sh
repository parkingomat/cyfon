    ## crt.sh checks the certificates associated to the domain and presents the subdomain data from the certs

    curl "https://crt.sh/?q=${input}" > /tmp/out.html

    # for right now i'm only doing a grep for the following domain extensions
    # .gov|.mil|.com|.us|.net|.biz|.io|.org
    # I will make this more robust later
    # I am grepping the output and cleaning it up with sed
    # I am sorting the domains that were grepped and making sure there are no duplicates with the uniq command
    # I am again saving this cleaned up list to a temp file on your localhost
